    <h2>Our approach</h2>
    <p>
    The Autocrypt effort is driven by a diverse group of mail app developers, hackers and researchers who are willing to take fresh approaches, learn from past mistakes, and collectively aim to increase the overall encryption of E-Mail in the net.</p>
    <p>Encrypted E-mail has been around for decades, but has failed to see wide adoption outside of specialist communities. Autocrypt aims to provide encryption convenient enough for much wider adoption. Through strenghtening the E-Mail ecosystem step-by-step, we want to increase user autonomy and privacy for everyone.</p>
